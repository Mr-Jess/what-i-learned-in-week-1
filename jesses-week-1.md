# What I learned in Week-1

---

During Week-1 many the topics below were covered. Started off in Week-0 with working in the computers terminal to add delete and edit folders or files. Git/GitHub is cloud based service to save and edit work publicly or privately. Cloning, forking and creating new repositories is made possible when using GitHub service and Git inside the computers text terminal.

## HTML

`HTML` is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

`HTML` stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and describes the skeleton of a web page. `HTML` consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the text content. HTML elements are represented by tags. `HTML` tags label parts of the content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on listed below...

Browsers do not display the `HTML` tags, but use them to read and write the content of the page to display as coded.

* `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines this document to be `HTML`. Use this at the top of a `HTML` coding document to let others know what type of project is being worked on.
* `<html>` is the root element of an HTML page.
* `<head>` contains meta information about the document. The head of the skeleton is where headings and titles of text shall be written.
* `<title>` specifies a title for the document.
* `<body>` contains the visible page content.
* `<h1> to <h6>` defines a large heading. Can be downsized by using higher numbers up to 6.
* `<p>` defines a paragraph.

## Advanced HTML

`HTML` also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning.

`HTML` uses elements like `<b>` and `<i>` for formatting output, like bold or italic text.

Formatting elements were designed to **display special types of text**:

* `<b>` - Bold text
* `<strong>` - Important text
* `<i>` - Italic text
* `<em>` - Emphasized text
* `<mark>` - Marked text
* `<small>` - Small text

`HTML` **colors** are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

`HTML` **Images** can improve the design and the appearance of a web page. Here is an example in `HTML`: `<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">`. Inside the first quotes is where your link goes. Inside the second quotes is the images description.

### The Adventures of Link

While in class, using `HTML` we created multiple `HTML` web links that told a creative story or learning tool.

`HTML` **links** are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

## Flowcharts

A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.

Creating flowcharts will help understand your plan of attack. Before creating new code or fixing code current issues, a flowchart will make that process more clear and can save time.
