# What I learned in week-1

**HTML** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

`HTML` stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and describes the skeleton of a web page. `HTML` consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the text content. HTML elements are represented by tags. `HTML` tags label parts of the content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on listed below...

Browsers do not display the `HTML` tags, but use them to read and write the content of the page to display as coded.

* `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines this document to be `HTML`. Use this at the top of a `HTML` coding document to let others know what type of project is being worked on.

* `<html>` is the root element of an HTML page.

* `<head>` contains meta information about the document. The head of the skeleton is where headings and titles of text shall be written.

* `<title>` specifies a title for the document.

* `<body>` contains the visible page content.

* `<h1>` defines a large heading. Can be downsized by using higher numbers up to 6.

* `<p>` defines a paragraph.
