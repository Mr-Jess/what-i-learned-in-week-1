**HTML** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

`HTML` stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and describes the skeleton of a web page. `HTML` consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the text content. HTML elements are represented by tags. `HTML` tags label parts of the content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on listed below...

Browsers do not display the `HTML` tags, but use them to read and write the content of the page to display as coded.
